The `page` event lets you record whenever a user sees a page, along with any optional properties about the page.
Each time Edgee collects a `page` event, it sends the data to the analytics components you've previously set up in your Edgee project.

## Event fields

The `page` event collects several fields about the page:

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`name` | String | The name of the page
`category` | String | The category of the page
`title` | String | The title of the page
`url` | String | The full url of the page, with scheme, host, path, and search
`path` | String | The path of the page
`search` | String | The search query of the page
`keywords` | Array | The keywords associated with the page
`properties` | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties of the page


## How to collect the `page` event?

### 1 - Automatically

If you followed the [Data Collection Highlights](/services/data-collection/overview), you've already installed the Edgee SDK on your website like that:
```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" src="https://{YOUR_DOMAIN}/_edgee/sdk.js" async></script>
```

<Note>Once you've installed it, Edgee collects the `page` event for each page viewed,
  setting the values of the above fields from the HTTP request or DOM.</Note>


### 2 - Manually (for SPAs)

In single-page applications, where navigation does not reload the entire webpage, manually triggering the `page` event
is necessary to accurately collect user movements across different views. Edgee’s SDK facilitates this through
the `edgee.page()` method, allowing developers to send `page` events with custom data whenever a user navigates to a
new part of the application. Here’s an example of how to manually trigger a `page` event:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('edgee:loaded', function(){
    edgee.page();
});
```

## Context Payload

You can manually specify each field by writing what we called a JSON **Context Payload** in your page.

Here is an example of how to insert a **Context Payload**:
```html
<script id="__EDGEE_CONTEXT__" type="application/json">
{
    "page": {
        "name": "welcome-page",
        "category": "welcome",
        "title": "Hello world!",
        "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html"
    }
}
</script>
```

In this example, we've specified the `name`, `category`, `title`, and `url` fields for the `page` event.
Edgee will use this information to enrich the data collected for each page view, providing a more detailed view of user interactions on your website.

To know more about the **Context Payload** capabilities, check the [dedicated documentation](/services/data-collection/context-payload).

## Fields gathering

You know now that the best way to specify the `page` fields is by using the **Context Payload**.
But here is a table that shows you how Edgee gathers the fields if you don't specify them:

Field | Type | Field definition order
----- | ---- | --------------------------
`name` | String | `context payload`, or by the page's `title` tag
`category` | String | This field is only defined by the `context payload`
`title` | String | `context payload`, or by the page's `title` tag
`url` | String | `context payload`, or the `canonical` tag, or the `http request`
`path` | String | `context payload`, or the `http request`
`search` | String | `context payload`, or the `http request`
`keywords` | Array | `context payload`, or the `keywords` meta tag
`properties` | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties, only defined by the `context payload`

Feel free to choose the best way to specify the `page` event fields, but remember that the **Context Payload** is the most powerful way to do it.

## Control the destinations of the events

If for some reason you don't want to send the `page` event to all the destinations you've set up in your Edgee project,
you can specify the destinations that will receive the event data in the **Context Payload**.

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_CONTEXT__" type="application/json">
{
    "page": {
        "name": "page-name",
        "category": "my-category",
        "title": "Hello world!",
        "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html"
    },
    "destinations": {
        "Google Analytics": true,
        "Amplitude": true,
        "Facebook Conversions API": false
    }
}
</script>
```

## More about manual triggering for SPAs

Edgee automatically collects `page` event when a page is called, but if you have a **single-page app**, that means it only collects a `page` once (when your app loads).

To make sure any navigating a user does within your app gets captured, you can make a `page` call manually using our SDK, **each time a
user navigates to a new part of your app**.

If you call the `edgee.page()` method without any parameters, Edgee will use the [fields gathering](#fields-gathering) we've seen before.
But to avoid having to change the **Context Payload** every time a user navigates, you can specify the fields directly in the `edgee.page()` method,
which will have the effect of overloading field gathering.

Here is an example of a complete `edgee.page()` call:

```javascript
// Syntax: edgee.page(pageObj, destinations);
edgee.page({
    "name": "page-name",
    "category": "my-category",
    "title": "Hello world!",
    "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html",
    "path": "/welcome.html",
    "search": "?utm_source=google",
    "keywords": ["hello", "world"],
    "properties": {
        "section": "political"
    }
}, {
    "Google Analytics": true,
    "Amplitude": true,
    "Facebook Conversions API": false
});
```

The `edgee.page()` method expect two optionals parameters:
Field |    | Type | Description
----- | -- | ---- | ---
`pageObj` | _optional_ | Object\|String | A dictionary object containing details of the `page` event. This object can include all the following optional fields: `name`, `category`, `title`, `url`, `path`, `search`, `keywords`, and `properties`. You can also provide a string that will be used as the `name` field.
`destinations` | _optional_ | Object | Specifies which analytics components should receive the event data. This allows for targeted data sending based on your configured components within the Edgee platform.


## Privacy by Design

At Edgee, we prioritize user privacy and the protection of personal data. Our approach to handling `page` event data is designed to 
respect user privacy by default, ensuring data is anonymized and processed in compliance with stringent data protection standards.

### Anonymization by Default

When processing `page` event data for analytics component, Edgee implements robust data anonymization techniques. These methods 
are designed to remove or alter personally identifiable information (PII), rendering it impossible to trace the data back to any individual. 
Through this process, data is stripped of identifying details, ensuring it cannot be used to track or identify users.

### The Option for PII Transmission

While our standard practice involves anonymizing all `page` event data, we recognize that certain analytics use cases 
may require the transmission of PII. Edgee supports this capability, allowing developers to include PII in `page` events 
if necessary. However, it's crucial to understand the implications:

- **User Consent is Paramount**: Before sending any PII through Edgee, you must obtain explicit consent from the users whose data is being collected. 
This consent should be informed, meaning users are fully aware of what data is collected and how it will be used.

- **Responsibility of the Developer**: If you choose to send PII with `page` events, the responsibility for managing that data in compliance with 
applicable privacy laws rests with you, the Edgee customer. You must ensure that your data collection practices adhere to GDPR, CCPA, or 
any other relevant data protection regulations.

### Conclusion

With anonymization, we guarantee that default `page` data sent to your analytics components cannot be used to identify and track an individual.
Therefore, **you don't need to ask for consent before sending default `page` event data to Edgee, as no personal data is sent**.

To know more about how we handle privacy, check the dedicated [Privacy](/services/data-collection/privacy) documentation.


## Best Practices for `page` Events

- **Rich Context**: The **Context Payload** allows for the specification of comprehensive context data for each event, enhancing the granularity of analytics data captured. Don't hesitate to provide as much information as possible about the page.
- **SPA Compatibility**: Edgee’s manual triggering capabilities ensure that SPAs can accurately collect pageviews without the traditional webpage reloads.
- **Flexible Destination Configuration**: Utilize the destinations parameter to fine-tune where your data is sent, optimizing for relevance and efficiency.
