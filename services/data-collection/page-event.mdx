The `page` event lets you record whenever a user sees a page, along with any optional properties about the page.
It's collected at edge, anonymously, witch offers you to collect 100% of the page views of your website.
Each time Edgee collects a `page` event, it sends the data to the analytics integrations you've previously set up in your Edgee project.

The `page` event collects several fields about the page:

Field | Type | Description
----- | ---- | ---
`name` | String | The name of the page
`category` | String | The category of the page
`title` | String | The title of the page
`url` | String | The full url of the page, with scheme, host, path, and search
`path` | String | The path of the page
`search` | String | The search query of the page
`keywords` | Array | The keywords associated with the page
`properties` | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties of the page

If you followed the [Data Collection Highlights](/services/data-collection/overview), you've already installed the Edgee SDK on your website like that:
```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" src="https://cdn.edgee.app/sdk.js" async></script>
```

Once you've installed it, Edgee collects the `page` event for each page viewed, automatically gathering the above fields from the HTTP request or the DOM.

## Context JSON Payload

You can manually specify each field by writing what we called a **Context JSON Payload** in your page, witch will override the automatic fields gathering.

Here is an example of how to insert a `Context Payload`:
```html
<script id="__EDGEE_CONTEXT__" type="application/json">
{
    "page": {
        "name": "welcome-page",
        "category": "welcome",
        "title": "Hello world!",
        "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html"
    }
}
</script>
```

In this example, we've specified the `name`, `category`, `title`, and `url` fields for the `page` event. 
Edgee will use this information to enrich the data collected for each page view, providing a more detailed view of user interactions on your website.

## Fields gathering

You know now that the best way to specify the `page` fields is by using the **Context JSON Payload**. 
But here is a table that shows you how Edgee gathers the fields if you don't specify them:

Field | Type | Order of field definition
----- | ---- | --------------------------
`name` | String | `context payload`, or by the page's `title` tag
`category` | String | This field is only defined by the `context payload`
`title` | String | `context payload`, or by the page's `title` tag
`url` | String | `context payload`, or the `canonical` tag, or the `http request`
`path` | String | `context payload`, or the `http request`
`search` | String | `context payload`, or the `http request`
`keywords` | Array | `context payload`, or the `keywords` meta tag
`properties` | Object | Free-form dictionary of properties, only defined by the `context payload`

Feel free to choose the best way to specify the `page` event fields, but remember that the **Context JSON Payload** is the most powerful way to do it.

## Control the destinations of the events

If for some reason you don't want to send the `page` event to all the destinations you've set up in your Edgee project, 
you can specify the destinations that will receive the event data in the **Context Payload**.

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_CONTEXT__" type="application/json">
{
    "page": {
        "name": "page-name",
        "category": "my-category",
        "title": "Hello world!",
        "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html"
    },
    "destinations": {
        "Google Analytics": true,
        "Amplitude": true,
        "Facebook Conversions API": false
    }
}
</script>
```

## Manual Triggering for SPAs

In single-page applications, where navigation does not reload the entire webpage, manually triggering the `page` event 
is necessary to accurately collect user movements across different views. Edgee’s SDK facilitates this through 
the `edgee.page` method, allowing developers to send `page` events with custom data whenever a user navigates to a 
new part of the application. Here’s an example of how to manually trigger a `page` event with detailed information:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('edgee:loaded', function(){
    // Syntax: edgee.page(pageName, details, destinations);
    edgee.page("page-name", {
        "category": "my-category",
        "title": "Hello world!",
        "url": "https://www.example.com/welcome.html",
        "properties": {
            "section": "political"
        }
    }, {
        "Google Analytics": true,
        "Amplitude": true,
        "Facebook Conversions API": false,
    });
});
```

### Parameters Explained

The page method expect three optionals parameters:
Field |    | Type | Description
----- | -- | ---- | ---
`pageName` | _optional_ | String | The name of the page
`details` | _optional_ | Object | A dictionary object containing details of the `page` event. This object can include the `category`, `title`, `url`, `path`, `search`, `keywords`, and `properties` fields.
`destinations` | _optional_ | Object | Specifies which analytics integrations should receive the event data. This allows for targeted data sending based on your configured integrations within the Edgee platform.

This functionality is especially powerful for SPAs, as it ensures that every user action is accurately 
captured and analyzed, providing insights into how users interact with your application.

## Key Takeaways

- **Rich Context**: The `context payload` allows for the specification of comprehensive context data for each event, enhancing the granularity of analytics data captured.
- **SPA Compatibility**: Edgee’s manual triggering capabilities ensure that SPAs can accurately track pageviews and user interactions without the traditional webpage reloads.
- **Flexible Destination Configuration**: Both the `context payload` and the SDK call allow for specifying analytics destinations, offering flexibility in how and where data is sent.

By leveraging these features, developers can ensure that their Edgee integration captures detailed, actionable insights into user behavior 
and page interactions, providing a solid foundation for data-driven decision-making.
