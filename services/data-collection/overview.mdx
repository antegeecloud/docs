With Edgee Data Collection service, you can run your current analytics solution at the edge, 100% privacy-friendly, and without any data loss,
whether it's **Google Analytics**, **Amplitude** or any other analytics tool, and even if it's your own first party analytics solution.

## How does it work?

Atfer creating your project and adding the SDK to your website or mobile application, Edgee will start capturing all the analytics events at the edge.

Edgee intercepts the HTTP responses from your backend, and **looks for the instructions you give it via the SDK**. 
When it finds the instructions, it triggers the analytics events directly at the edge, without having to wait for the client to execute any code.

## The first instruction is the presence of the SDK itself

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" src="https://cdn.edgee.app/sdk.js" async></script>
```

As long as this snippet **isn't** installed in your pages, the Edgee proxy 
doesn't perform any processing (_except for the security services that run on each request_).

Once the SDK is added, Edgee automatically captures `page` events (pageview) at the edge.

You will see in the next pages how to manage the `page` event, and how to manually trigger other events using Edgee SDK.


## Bots

Unlike server-side analytics technology, Edgee is able to detect bots thanks to a proprietary challenge mechanism. 
Our strength lies in being present at the edge, but also on the client side, thanks to our SDK.
This enables us to collect only data from real humans.
