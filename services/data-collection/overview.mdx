With Edgee Data Collection service, you can run your analytics solution at the edge, enabling it to collect 100% of the data,
whether it's **Google Analytics**, **Amplitude** or any other analytics tool, and even if it's your own first party analytics solution.

## How does it work?

Atfer creating your project and adding the SDK to your website or mobile application, Edgee will start capturing all the analytics events at the edge.

Edgee intercepts the HTTP responses from your backend, and **looks for the instructions you give it via the SDK**. 
When it finds the instructions, it triggers the analytics events directly at the edge, without having to wait for the client to execute any code.

## The first instruction is the presence of the SDK itself

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" src="https://cdn.edgee.app/sdk.js" async></script>
```

As long as this snippet **isn't** installed in your pages, the Edgee proxy 
doesn't perform any processing (_except for the security services that run on each request_).

Once the SDK is added, Edgee automatically captures [page](/services/data-collection/page-event) (pageview) events at the edge.

## Single-page apps and page event

Edgee automatically collects `page` event when a page is called. 
If you have a single-page app, that means it only collects a `page` once (when your app loads).

To make sure any navigating a user does within your app gets captured, you can make a `page` call manually using our SDK.

```javascript
edgee.page('name of my page');
```

## Bots

Unlike server-side analytics technology, Edgee is able to detect bots thanks to a proprietary challenge mechanism. 
Our strength lies in being present at the edge, but also on the client side, thanks to our SDK.
This enables us to collect only data from real humans.
