The `track` event is essential for capturing detailed user interactions. Unlike the `page` event, which can be collected at the edge, 
the `track` event is inherently client-side, as it aims to capture the nuanced and dynamic actions users perform. 
This guide delves into how to implement and make the most of the `track` event using Edgee's SDK.

## Overview

The `track` call is a versatile method for recording any actions your users take, 
along with descriptive properties about those actions. Each `track` event is identified by a name, 
such as "User Subscribe," and can be enriched with properties like "billing plan" to provide context. 
These events are crucial for understanding user behavior, measuring the effectiveness of features, and optimizing the user experience.

## Implementing a `track` Event

Implementing a `track` event with Edgee's SDK is straightforward. Here's a breakdown of how to structure a `track` call:

```javascript
// Syntax: edgee.track(eventName, details, destinations);
edgee.track("color choice", {
    "color": "blue",
    "category": "shoes",
    "label": "Blue Sneakers"
}, {
    "Google Analytics": true,
    "Amplitude": true,
    "Facebook Conversions API": true,
});
```

In this example, the `track` event captures a "color choice" event, detailing the item's color, category, and label.
Additionally, you can specify the analytics destinations where this event data should be sent. If the destinations parameter is not 
specified, Edgee will look at the `context payload` if destinations are specified. If not, the event will be sent to all your destinations.

### Parameters Explained

field |    | type | description
--- | -- |--- | ---
`eventName` | _required_ | string | A descriptive name for the action being recorded (e.g., "button click").
`details` | _optional_ | object | A free-form dictionary object containing details of the `track` event. This object can include any relevant information that provides context to the event.
`destinations` | _optional_ | object | Specifies which analytics integrations should receive the event data. This allows for targeted data sending based on your configured integrations within the Edgee platform.

## Sending Data to Analytics Integrations

Upon triggering a `track` event, Edgee ensures that the collected data is sent to the analytics integrations you've configured in your account. 
This seamless integration enables a holistic view of user interactions across your chosen analytics platforms, providing a rich dataset for analysis and decision-making.

## Best Practices for `track` Events

- **Descriptive Event Names**: Use clear and descriptive names for your events to ensure that data is easily understandable and actionable.
- **Relevant Properties**: Include properties that offer valuable insights into the event. Avoid overloading events with unnecessary data to maintain clarity.
- **Selective Destination Sending**: Utilize the destinations parameter to fine-tune where your data is sent, optimizing for relevance and efficiency.
