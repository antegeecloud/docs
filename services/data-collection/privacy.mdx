In today's digital landscape, privacy and data protection are of paramount importance. Edgee is deeply committed to 
upholding the highest standards of user privacy and data security. This document outlines our privacy practices, 
focusing on how we anonymize data before sending it to analytics destinations, ensuring compliance with global data protection regulations.

## Anonymizing Data: How We Protect User Privacy

At Edgee, we employ data anonymization techniques to ensure that personal information cannot be linked back to any individual. 
Our approach centers on two key aspects: **IP address** handling and **Cookie ID** management.

### IP Address Anonymization

The fundamental problem hindering client-side analytics data collection is that of direct contact, via an HTTPS connection, 
between the person's terminal and data processing servers.

The resulting requests generally enable these servers to obtain the Internet user's IP address, as well as a wide range of information 
about his or her terminal. Realistically, this information can be used to re-identify the user and, consequently, to access his or her 
browsing habits on all sites using the same audience measurement tool.

**Edgee, operating at the edge as a proxy, breaks the contact between the terminal and the analytics solution.**

- **Proxy Handling**: Edgee operates as a proxy, meaning that all requests to analytics services are made through Edgee's servers. 
As a result, the client's IP address is never directly transmitted to any third parties. This layer of indirection ensures that the user's IP address, 
a potentially identifiable piece of information, remains private and unexposed.

- **Server-side Request**: When Edgee forwards data to analytics platforms, it is Edgee's server IP that is logged, not the client's. 
This ensures that analytics data cannot be used to pinpoint or trace back to an individual's IP address.

### Cookie ID Management

- **First-party Cookie**: Edgee utilizes a first-party cookie to assign a unique ID to each user. This ID serves a dual purpose: 

  1. Verifying that the user is a genuine person (not a bot) 

  2. Enabling session to understand user recurrence over time

- **Privacy-focused ID Use**: Importantly, this Cookie ID is exclusively for internal use within Edgee's edge processing environment. 
It is never shared with analytics destinations, thereby preventing any possibility of it being used to identify individuals.

- **Edge-generated IDs**: For each analytics integration configured in Edgee, new, distinct user IDs are generated at the edge. 
These IDs are used to maintain session continuity and user distinction across different analytics tools without revealing 
or transmitting any personally identifiable information.

## Ensuring Compliance and Upholding Trust

- **Data Minimization**: Edgee practices data minimization, collecting only what is necessary to deliver valuable insights and analytics. 
This principle is key to respecting user privacy and adhering to legal frameworks.

- **Compliance with Global Regulations**: Our data processing and anonymization practices are designed to comply with major data protection 
laws such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe, the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) in the United States, 
and other relevant privacy regulations worldwide.

- **Transparent Practices**: Edgee believes in transparency and user empowerment. We provide clear information about our data handling practices, 
giving users and customers confidence in how their data is managed.

## Technical and Organizational Measures

- **Encryption**: All data transmitted to and from Edgee is encrypted using industry-standard protocols, ensuring that data in transit remains secure.

- **Regular Audits**: Edgee undergoes regular security and privacy audits to ensure our practices remain robust and in line with the latest standards and regulations.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Our commitment to privacy and data protection is ongoing. We continuously evaluate and update our practices 
to address emerging privacy concerns and technological advancements.

## Conclusion

Edgee's dedication to privacy is foundational to our mission. By anonymizing data and employing rigorous privacy measures, 
we strive to empower businesses with powerful analytics insights while steadfastly protecting user privacy. Our approach 
ensures that businesses can leverage the benefits of edge computing and analytics without compromising on their users' trust and confidence.
