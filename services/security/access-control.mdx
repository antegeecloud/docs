description: Secure your website or application with powerful access control mechanisms

In the Edgee platform, the Access Control feature within the Security settings of your project allows you to safeguard your website
or application using several powerful methods:

### Password Protection

This feature requires all visitors to enter a predefined password before accessing your site or app,
adding a layer of security that protects your content from unauthorized access.

</Frame>

### Trusted IPs

Enhance security by allowing access only from known, trusted IP addresses.
This setting ensures that only visitors from specified IPs can reach your application, effectively blocking unwanted or potentially harmful traffic.

### Blocked IPs

Conversely, you can specify IP addresses that are denied access to your site or app.
This is useful for preventing access from known problematic sources and maintaining public accessibility without exposing your site to certain risks.
