Edgee stands at the forefront of edge computing, redefining how applications interact with the internet.
As a cutting-edge **proxy** technology, Edgee is installed directly at the network edge, positioning it as the
intermediary between your users and your application's backend. This strategic placement allows Edgee to
offer unparalleled performance enhancements, security features, and data processing capabilities.


## Leveraging Rust and WebAssembly for Performance and Reliability

Built with Rust and compiled into WebAssembly, Edgee delivers the robustness, safety, and execution speed necessary
for high-performance edge computing. This technology stack ensures that Edgee runs efficiently across our
global network, providing consistent, near-native performance.

## Global Network, Local Presence

With a distribution of over 100 Points of Presence (PoPs) worldwide, Edgee ensures that your application
benefits from low latency and high availability, no matter where your users are located.
By processing requests and data at the edge, closest to the user, Edgee dramatically improves response times and user experience.

By acting as a proxy at the edge, Edgee doesn't replace your hosting, it completes it by adding a layer of 
intelligence and security that is both scalable and globally available within milliseconds.

## Seamless Integration into Your Workflow

You can integrate Edgee into your infrastructure in two ways:

- **Serverless**: By pointing your domain name to our network using a 
simple CNAME rule, Edgee becomes the first destination for your user's requests. 
You don't need to worry about managing servers or scaling infrastructure, we take care of it for you.
This seamless integration ensures that your users always experience the fastest possible access to your edge services.

- **Self-hosted**: While we recommend using Edgee serverless for optimal performance 
and ease of use, we provide the flexibility to self-host our platform.
Whether integrated as an ingress controller within your Kubernetes (k8s) cluster or deployed traditionally via containers, 
Edgee adapts to your infrastructure needs. We provide a Helm chart for easy installation and management within your k8s cluster.
If you're utilizing a CDN, you have the option to deploy Edgee within your CDN's infrastructure to harness our edge computing 
capabilities, provided that your CDN is an Edgee partner. Should this deployment method interest you, 
please reach out to our team for further details.
