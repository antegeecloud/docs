title: What is Edgee?
description: A platform offering a suite of services for edge-oriented applications
---

Edgee is an innovative edge platform designed to transform how workloads and data are
processed across the internet. 

Edgee empowers developers to build and deploy **edge-oriented applications**.
This approach to application development harnesses the potential of edge computing,
enabling workloads to run closer to users than ever before. 

Edgee is cross-platform, whether your application is hosted on **AWS**, **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or any other cloud provider, 
Edgee can be used to enhance your application.

By minimizing the distance data has to travel, Edgee significantly **reduces latency**, enhances **performance**, and
ensures greater **privacy** and **compliance** with data protection regulations.

With over **100 points of presence** globally, and a **300 Tbps** global capacity, Edgee offers an unparalleled infrastructure
that enables developers to deploy a wide range of services directly at the edge of the network.

## Defining Edge-Oriented Applications

Edge-oriented applications are specifically designed to take advantage of the computational
power and data processing capabilities at the edge of the network.

Unlike traditional cloud-based applications, which rely on central data centers,
edge-oriented applications run some of their workloads at the network's periphery,
enabling real-time data processing and decision-making closer to the data source.
