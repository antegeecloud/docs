Edgee offers the easiest and most powerful Edge libraries to remove recurring technological 
hurdles and offer faster, broader and safer connectivities.

With Edgee's technologies, intensive and sensitive tasks are shifted away from browsers and mobile 
applications to the network layer, benefiting from distributed processing. This allows for faster
processing, reduced network congestion, and enhanced application performance.

## What's Edge Computing?

In the era of data explosion, edge computing is the next frontier. It moves computation from devices and
traditional data centers to the 'edge', closer to where data is generated and used. This results in faster
data processing, reduced network congestion, and enhanced application performance.

## Why Edgee?

Edgee is a platform that enables developers to build and deploy edge applications. It provides a
suite of tools and services that complement cloud computing, enabling applications to interact at the network
layer (edge). This allows the offloading of resource-intensive tasks, traditionally handled by devices, to the
edge, including analytics, A/B testing, web performance optimization, content stitching, and more.

Edgee Proxy is a high-performance, low-latency proxy that runs on the edge.
