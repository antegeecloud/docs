Adding our JavaScript SDK to your HTML is required to get Edgee up and running. It only takes a few minutes. 
Copy the snippet below, then add it to your HTML document - ideally just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" src="https://{YOUR_SDK_URL}/_edgee/sdk.js" async></script>
```

Replace `{YOUR_SDK_URL}` with the URL provided in the Edgee console, in the project overview section.

If your application is built with a framework like React, Angular, or Vue, we recommend adding the 
snippet to the main template file exactly as shown above.

> You might wonder, "If Edgee processes everything at the edge, why add a client-side SDK?" 
>
> Great question! This SDK acts as a bridge, allowing Edgee's edge processing capabilities to kick in. 
> When the Edgee proxy intercepts this script, it triggers analytics events and other services directly at the edge. 
> This means **you get real-time processing without compromising your website's performance**.


<Tip>If your immediate need is just a basic Google Analytics setup, then congratulations, your integration journey ends here! 
  Simply activate Google Analytics from within the Edgee console, and you're all set.</Tip>

### Testing Edgee locally

To test Edgee locally, you have two options:

1. Integrate the SDK of your project in your local environment and... that's it! With this simple step, the SDK will run only client-side, 
   so you won't benefit from Edgee's edge processing capabilities. But it's a good way to test your application's behavior with the SDK.

2. Integrate the SDK **AND** install Edgee open-source proxy on your local machine. This way, you can test the full capabilities of Edgee, including edge processing. 
   To do this, follow the instructions in the [Edgee open-source repository](/open-source/overview)


### Next Steps

After embedding the Edgee SDK, you're ready for leveraging edge computing's full power
and you can now start using Edgee's services. 
 
In the next page, you'll find comprehensive guides on activating and customizing features such as advanced analytics, AB testing, 
security measures, and more, ensuring your web application not only performs efficiently but also delivers a superior user experience.
