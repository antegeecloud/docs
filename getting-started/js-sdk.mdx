Adding our JavaScript SDK to your HTML is the simplest way to get Edgee up and running. It only takes a few minutes. 
Copy the snippet below, then add it to your HTML document - ideally just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" src="https://{YOUR_SDK_URL}/_edgee/sdk.js" async></script>
```

If your application is built with a framework like React, Angular, or Vue, we recommend adding the 
snippet to the main template file exactly as shown above.

> You might wonder, "If Edgee processes everything at the edge, why add a client-side SDK?" 
>
> Great question! This SDK acts as a bridge, allowing Edgee's edge processing capabilities to kick in. 
> When the Edgee proxy intercepts this script, it triggers analytics events and other services directly at the edge. 
> This means **you get real-time processing without compromising your website's performance**.


<Tip>If your immediate need is just a basic Google Analytics setup, then congratulations, your integration journey ends here! 
  Simply activate Google Analytics from within the Edgee console, and you're all set.</Tip>
