Add the JavaScript snippet to your HTML is the simplest way to get Edgee up and running. It only takes a few minutes. 
Copy the snippet below, then add it to your HTML document - ideally just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<script id="__EDGEE_SDK__" src="https://cdn.edgee.app/sdk.js" async></script>
```


> **Hold on a second!** ðŸ«¤

> You might wonder, "If Edgee processes everything at the edge, why add a snippet to my client-side code?" 
>
> Great question! This snippet acts as a bridge, allowing Edgee's edge processing capabilities to kick in. 
> When the Edgee proxy intercepts this script, it triggers analytics events and other services directly at the edge. 
> This means **you get real-time processing without compromising your website's performance**.
> 
> As long as this snippet isn't installed in your pages, the Edgee proxy doesn't perform any processing (_except for the security services that run on each request_).

<Tip>If your immediate need is just a basic Google Analytics setup, then congratulations, your integration journey ends here! 
  Simply activate Google Analytics from within the Edgee console, and you're all set.</Tip>
