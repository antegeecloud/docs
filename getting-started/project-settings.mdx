A `project` in Edgee is an edge computing application, that operates across all 
our [available edge locations](introduction/network-map). 

Each service you deploy or update within your project is rapidly propagated to all our 
Points of Presence (PoPs) around the world, ensuring changes take effect in seconds.

## Creating a Project

To start creating a project, use the top-left Switcher in the Edgee console and click on the Create project button.

### Step 1: Enter the project URL and Description

Begin by entering a project name, which serves as a unique identifier and will be part 
of your project's URL. You can optionally add a description to help you and your team remember the project's purpose.

  />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  **Can I add my own URL?**<br/>
  Yes of course, don't worry, you could do it in the next steps.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Set up the first routing rules

Edgee is a reverse proxy technology, meaning it receives requests and directs them to designated 
backends based on your routing rules.

    align={"center"}
  />
</Frame>

Begin by setting up your first routing rule:

1. Select the protocol (`HTTP` or `HTTPS`) by clicking on the protocol field.
2. Enter the address of your first backend. Could be a hostname or an IP address (v4 or v6).

/>

Beneath the address field, you'll find an accordion for advanced settings. 
For detailed guidance on all available routing rule options, please visit our [routing rules documentation](/docs/routing-rules).

<Warning>
  **Can I set up more complex routing rules?**<br/>
  Yeah, you can! There's no need to be in such a hurry! You'll see how in just a few minutes.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Your project is ready!

Congratulations! Your project is now configured and is currently being propagated across all our 
Points of Presence (PoPs). Edgee has automatically assigned a **.edgee.app** domain to your project. 
Use this domain to test and ensure your project is functioning as expected.

#### Adding Your Own Domain _(optional)_:

Navigate to the Domains card in your project dashboard.
Click on the Add Domain button and follow the prompts to link your custom domain. 
To know more about how to add a domain, you can read the [domains documentation](/docs/domains).

#### Integrate the SDK:

Once your domain is set up, the final step is to integrate the Edgee SDK into your website. 
Detailed instructions for this process can be found [here](/getting-started/js-sdk). This integration is essential for 
activating all the features and capabilities of your Edgee project on your site.

<Warning>
  **Create a dedicated project for each of your environments**<br/>
  We strongly recommend that you create a dedicated project for each of your environments (prod, staging, dev) to avoid affecting your production.
