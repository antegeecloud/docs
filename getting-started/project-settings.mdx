description: Create and manage a project in Edgee.
---

A `project` in Edgee is an edge computing application. It runs on the Edgee platform, on all available edge locations around the world,
without having to worry about managing servers or scaling infrastructure.

Each time you create a service on Edgee, it is deployed to all our Points of Presence (PoPs) around the world.
Each time you change your project settings, or you add a component to your project, your changes are propagated to all the PoPs in a matter of seconds.

## Creating a Project

To create a project, you can use the top left Switcher, and click on the `Create project` button.

### Step 1: Enter the project URL and Description

The first step is to enter the project name and a description. The project name is the unique identifier for your project, and it will be used in the URL of your project.
Don't hesitate to add a description to your project, it will help you and your team to remember what this project is about.

<Warning>
  **Can I add my own URL?**<br/>
  Yes of course, don't worry, you could do it in the next steps.

### Step 2: Set up the first routing rules

Edgee is a reverse proxy, which means it receives requests and forwards them to one or more backends.
Routing rules are used to define how the incoming requests are forwarded to the backends.

To create a project, we need a first routing rule. You should define the protocol and address of your first backend.
Click on the protocol to select between `HTTP` and `HTTPS`, and enter the address of your backend.

You can see a little accordion below the address field. This is the advanced settings. 
To know more about all the routing rules settings, you can read the [routing rules documentation](/docs/routing-rules).

<Warning>
  **Can I set up more complex routing rules?**<br/>
  Yeah, you can! There's no need to be in such a hurry! You'll see how in just a few minutes.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Your project is ready!

Congratulations! Your project is now configured and is currently being propagated across all our 
Points of Presence (PoPs). Edgee has automatically assigned a **.edgee.app** domain to your project. 
Use this domain to test and ensure your project is functioning as expected.

#### Adding Your Own Domain:

Navigate to the Domains card in your project dashboard.
Click on the Add Domain button and follow the prompts to link your custom domain.

#### Integrate the SDK:

Once your domain is set up, the final step is to integrate the Edgee SDK into your website. 
Detailed instructions for this process can be found [here](/getting-started/js-sdk). This integration is essential for 
activating all the features and capabilities of your Edgee project on your site.

<Warning>
  **Create a dedicated project for each of your environments**<br/>
  We strongly recommend that you create a dedicated project for each of your environments (prod, staging, dev) to avoid affecting your production.
