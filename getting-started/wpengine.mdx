Edgee can act as a proxy in front of your WP Engine site to **improve performance**, **enhance security**, and **simplify integrations**.

This setup ensures all traffic flows through Edgee first, while WP Engine continues to serve your content.

## Edgee Setup Overview

Integrating Edgee with WP Engine involves two main steps:

1. **Connect your domain to Edgee** – configure Edgee routing so your domain points to your WP Engine origin.  
2. **Contact WP Engine support** – request that they enable proxy support and allow Edgee’s public IPs.

---

### Step 1 — Connect Your Domain to Edgee

1. Log in to your **Edgee** dashboard.  
2. Go to **Project Settings → Routing**.  
3. Click **Create New Route** and set the **Origin URL** to your WP Engine install (e.g., `https://my.domain.com`).  
   - Configure **Origin URL** to your WP Engine or Webserver IP address
   - Configure **Host Override**, **SNI**, and **Cert Hostname** with your domain.  
4. Save and activate the configuration.  
5. Update your DNS so your domain points to **Edgee**. See [Routing Guide](/getting-started/routing)

<Note>
This ensures all requests to your WP Engine site flow through Edgee first.

### Step 2 — Contact WP Engine Support

1. Contact **WP Engine Support** via your account dashboard.  
2. Request that they:  
   - Enable reverse proxy support for your install.  
   - Allow traffic from **[Edgee’s public IP ranges](https://api.fastly.com/public-ip-list)**.  

Once enabled, your WP Engine site will be fully accessible through Edgee.

With this setup, Edgee sits in front of WP Engine to deliver faster performance, stronger security, and more control—while WP Engine continues to power your content and publishing workflow.
