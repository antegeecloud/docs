The best way to get started with Edgee is to use our Docker container. Simply run:

```console
docker run -v ./edgee.toml:/app/edgee.toml -p 80:80 -p 443:443 edgeecloud/edgee 
```

More often, you'll use it in a `docker-compose.yml` file in combination with other services. Here's an example:

```yaml
services:
  edgee:
    image: edgeecloud/edgee
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - "./edgee.toml:/app/edgee.toml"
  website:
    build: ./website
  api:
    build: ./api
```

## Configuration

To configure Edgee properly, you need to understand two concepts: entrypoints and routing tables.

### Entrypoints

Edgee needs to accept HTTP and HTTPS connections to route traffic. These entrypoints can be configured to listen to specific 
IP addresses and ports. For HTTPS, you can also provide the certificates for the TLS handshake.

In the HTTP entrypoint, if `force_https` is set to `true`, all requests are redirected to the same URL using the 
HTTPS protocol instead.

```toml
[http]
address = "0.0.0.0:80"
force_https = true

[https]
address = "0.0.0.0:443"
cert = "/app/cert/server.pem"
key = "/app/cert/server.key"
```

#### Observability

There's an optional entrypoint that can be configured for observability.

```toml
[monitor]
address = "0.0.0.0:8222"
```

### Routing Tables

Routing tables map routing rules to backends. You can also apply transformations to the path and configure how to connect to 
different backends.

#### Domains

You will configure one routing table for each domain you want to support. The simplest routing table maps one domain to one backend.

```toml
[[routing]]
domain = "example.com"
[[routing.backend]]
name = "example"
default = true
address = "backend.com:8080"
```

#### SSL

You can enable SSL for the connection with the backend using `enable_ssl = true`. By default, it is set to `false`.

#### Routing Rules

You can apply more complex matching logic and rewrite paths. For example, you can match only a specific path.

```toml
[[routing]]
domain = "example.com"

[[routing.rules]]
path = "/api/"
backend = "api"

[[routing.backend]]
name = "website"
default = true
address = "198.162.0.1:80"

[[routing.backend]]
name = "api"
address = "198.162.0.2:80"
```

The example above directs all traffic from `example.com` to `198.162.0.1:80` except for `example.com/api/`, 
which will be directed to `198.162.0.2:80`. Other available matchers are `path_prefix` and `path_regex`.
