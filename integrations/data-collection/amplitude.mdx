description: Build better products by turning your user data into meaningful insights, using Amplitude's digital analytics platform, **now at the edge**.

Amplitude, a comprehensive product analytics platform, is seamlessly integrated with Edgee, allowing you to leverage 
its robust analytics capabilities directly from the edge. This integration bypasses the need for embedding Amplitude's SDK directly into your site, 
offering significant improvements in privacy and website performance.

Edgee uses Amplitude's HTTP API to send events directly to Amplitude, ensuring secure and direct data transmission from the edge to Amplitude.

<Note>
  Amplitude integration accepts `page`, `identify`, and `track` events.

## Getting Started

**To integrate Amplitude into your Edgee project:**

1. Open the Edgee console and navigate to your project's Data Collection service.
2. Select "Add Destination" and choose "Amplitude" from the list of available integrations.
3. Enter your Amplitude `API Key` and click Save to complete the integration. <br />
_(Your API Key can be found in the Amplitude Dashboard under Settings > Organization Settings > Project Settings > General > API Keys.)_
4. With the integration complete, you're ready to begin sending analytics events to Amplitude.


## Destination name

When configuring the destination in your **Context Payload** or within SDK calls, use `Amplitude` as the destination name to ensure accurate data routing.

```json
{
  "destinations": {
    "Amplitude": true
  }
}
```
