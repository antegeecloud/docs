Edgee was founded on the realization that several traditional client-side technologies don't work for a significant portion of user, 
primarily due to legal constraints, technical limitations, and the widespread use of ad blockers.
Our platform is built to address these challenges by moving client-side SDKs to the edge, close to the user, 
ensuring real-time processing, anonymity, and compliance with global data protection laws.
This guide will walk you through the basics of getting started with Edgee, 
from setting up your account to implementing our libraries in your applications.
