## Creating an Organization

After successfully logging in, you will arrive at your **personal account** overview page.
Your personal account is the place where you can manage your personal information, change your password. You can also create a project, but only for your personal use.

To create a project and invite other users to collaborate, you need to create an organization.
In the Edgee console, you always have a switcher in the top left corner of the screen.
This tool allows you to switch between different organizations, and also to create a new organization.

After clicking on the "Create organization" button, you will be prompted to enter the name of the new organization and its URL.
And that's it! You have successfully created a new organization.

You are now ready to create **your first project**!
