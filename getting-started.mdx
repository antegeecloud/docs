Client-side technologies don't work for a significant portion of user, due to legal constraints, technical limitations, and ad blockers.
Our platform is built to solve these problems by moving client-side SDKs to the edge, close to the user,
ensuring real-time processing, anonymity, and compliance with global data protection laws.
This guide will walk you through the basics of getting started with Edgee,
from setting up your account to implementing our libraries in your applications.
